"""
converter.py: This module defines the TxtToQtiConverter class, which handles the conversion of text-based question banks to QTI packages.

The TxtToQtiConverter class provides methods to read text files containing questions, parse them, and generate QTI-compliant packages.

Main Features:
- Read and parse text files
- Generate QTI packages from parsed questions
- Handle exceptions during conversion

Example Usage:
    >>> from txttoqti.converter import TxtToQtiConverter
    >>> converter = TxtToQtiConverter()
    >>> qti_file = converter.convert_file("questions.txt")
    >>> print(f"QTI package created: {qti_file}")
